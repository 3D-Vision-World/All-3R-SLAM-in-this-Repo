# awesome 3D Geometric Foundation Models and Application

Note: I just saw a more comprehensive repository that organizes papers in this field: “[https://github.com/ruili3/awesome-dust3r](https://github.com/ruili3/awesome-dust3r).” Therefore, we may stop maintaining our repository, and I am considering syncing the information from our repository to theirs.
